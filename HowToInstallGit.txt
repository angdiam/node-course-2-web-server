install git at https://git-scm.com There you can find a free book
On Mac just say yes to all. On Windows you need to add Bash terminal

On a new terminal go to your project folder for example node-web-server
$git --version
$git init    //need to be executed from the root of the project Creates a .git folder in your project
$ls -a   list all folders including the hidden ones
Never update git folder manually, we will write commands for this

By default git does not track all your files. You have to specify which ones.
Folders like node_modules should not be tracked as the user should install this from his machine and vary
from machine and version
$git status      shows the files that are untracked

$git add package.json      Will add that file to the tracked files to be saved/committed
$git status

$git add public/
$git add server.js
$git add views/

Make a new file .gitignore  This is the file that git reads and what ever file or folder you put in the git will ignore it
$git status
$git add .gitignore

Now it is time to commit save our files
$git commit -m 'Initial commit'       the -m message is necessary so we recognise the commit by name
Now we have saved the project in its current state and we can revert to that in the future if we want


GIT IS FOR VERSION CONTROL IN YOUR MACHINE NOW WE WILL TALK ABOUT GITHUB TO PUSH YOUR CODE IN TO
A SERVER SO YOUR STORE YOUR GIT REPOSITORY IN A 3RD PARTY SERVER
IN WINDOWS YOU NEED TO TYPE ALL COMMANDS FRON BASH TERMINAL
We use SSH keys to identify that the right PC talks to the right server. Google github ssh keys for more Generate SSH Keys

First we need to check if your PC has an SSH key and if not we will create it
$ls -al      //is list all     ~ is a shortcut for the user directory
if there are an ssh keys these will be at the ~/.ssh folder
$ls -al ~/.ssh   //if you have a file id_rsa then you have a key
To generate a key type the following exactly
$ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C 'myemailaddress'
press enter to the 2 questions asked and the public/private keys have been created
$ls -al ~/.ssh shoudl now  show id_rsa which is your private key and you never give away
and id_rsa.pub which is your public key which you will need to pass to github,heroku services
Now we need to run the ssh agent to add this key which will know to pass to github
$eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"    //this runs the agent you should get something like Agent pid 16547 different number
$ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa   //this tells the agent where to find the private key
you should get Identity added

Goto github.com and sign up/in
I used my yahoo email and password is Mygithub1
Go to Settings>SSH and GPG Keys Give ita title e.g. macbookpro13
Follow the instructions in https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/
copy paste the command to terminal and this will copy the id_rsa.pub to clipboard so you paste it in Github and submit
To confirm that everything has gone well we will try communicating with github
$ssh -T git@github.com
Say yes and should receive a Hi by  Github

At home of github.com > New Repository and name it node-course-2-web-server
Create Repository
we want "...push an existing repository from the command line"
We will copy paste the 2 commands to the terminal
The first command remote says to what url to push the code. Right now we want git but later we will add another remote
for heroku
git remote add origin https://github.com/angdiam/node-course-2-web-server.git
the second command   $
git push -u origin master
actually pushes the code to the github and now our repository has our project code
Now you can see your repository
You will never need to set up the ssh keys again for this pc
