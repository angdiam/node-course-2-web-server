On Mac just say yes to all. On Windows you need to add Bash terminal

On a new terminal go to your project folder for example node-web-server
$git --version
$git init    //need to be executed from the root of the project Creates a .git folder in your project
$ls -a   list all folders including the hidden ones
Never update git folder manually, we will write commands for this

By default git does not track all your files. You have to specify which ones.
Folders like node_modules should not be tracked as the user should install this from his machine and vary
from machine and version
$git status      shows the files that are untracked

$git add package.json      Will add that file to the tracked files to be saved/committed
$git status

$git add public/
$git add server.js
$git add views/

Make a new file .gitignore  This is the file that git reads and what ever file or folder you put in the git will ignore it
$git status
