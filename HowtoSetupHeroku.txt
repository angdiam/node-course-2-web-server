Go to heroku.com and sign in
yahoo email and Myheroku1

toolbelt.heroku.com  Install the heroku Command Line which will let us deploy our apps
$heroku --help  will install the CLI and then show you the help
$heroku login
put in your log in details
Now you can communicate between your machine command line and the heroku servers
We can get started creatign and deploying applications
$heroku keys:add   to add your public ssh key to heroku
press yes
$heroku keys   //prints all our keys in heroku
if you want to remove a key then
$heroku keys:remove emailassociated

To test our communication with heroku
 $ssh -v git@heroku.com
 This will return a lot of things
 It will say are you sure ? authenticity of the host can not be established
 press yes
 If successful you will see "authentication succeeded (publickey)" otherwise
 you will see "permission denied(public key)"

 In orderto push our app to heroku, it demands that instead of the localhost:3000 in the listener
 in server.js we place an enviroment variable.
 You can see your pc environment variables
 $env   or $SET on windows

 heroku will set the variable port
 const port = process.env.PORT || 3000 //this set the port to the PORT variable that heroku
 uses but we also set OR to 3000 so the app still runs in our machine
 process.env is an object with key:value pairs containing all the environment variables
 Now replace 3000 in the listener with port
Once heroku starts the app it should run $node server.js
however heroku does not know which file to start
Instead heroku runs a script
Therefore go to package.json and in scripts add a new line
"start": "node server.js"   //heroku is looking for that start script to run our app
if you type $npm start from your project folder this is similar to $node server.js
$npm test  //will run tests but for the moment we have no tests set up
